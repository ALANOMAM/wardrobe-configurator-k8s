## Description

The project is a very simple wardrobe elements configurator with a 3d page that helps you see the elements and modify them. The project contains:

- A homepage with a form where you can create a wardrobe project from scratch.
- A wardrobes page where you can see the list of all the wardrobe projects you have created. In that page you can update, delete and have access to a 3d represetation of the elements in your wardrobe project.
- A 3d page where you can see the elements of a specific wordrobe project. By clicking on each element, a modal appears and gives you the ability to modify the dimensions of the wardrobe elements .

- The elements were created by me from scratch using BLENDER, in combination with the THREE.JS library, i was able to create a simple and interractive 3d page.
- I used CSS and PRIMEREACT library for styling.
